Report objective
This report consists of three sections, each addressing a different area of Machine Learning and Data Mining. Part 1 dives into the problems of Attrition, an inevitable part of every company. The goal is to find the reasons for the high Attrition rate in a fictional dataset to reduce company costs on time and money to then fix the aftermath. Part 2 focuses on the creation of a regression model using an insurance dataset to predict trends in the data. Part 3 examines association rules and their application in the context of streaming companies.
